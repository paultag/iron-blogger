The rules are pretty simple:

 * Blog at least once a week.
 * If you fail to do so, pay $5 into a common pool.
 * When the pool is big enough, the group uses it to pay for drinks
   and snacks at a meet-up for all the participants.

Nelson Elhage ran the original Iron Blogger for about a year before the
effort ran out of steam. Mako Hill started a new instance with a couple
people from the previous group and a bunch of folks from Berkman, MIT,
and beyond. After a year, Mako left us, and we've risen from the ashes
like a glorious phoenix.

If you live in Boston and want to join, there are still a couple of spots
available. I’m going to cap the current group, at least temporarily, at
about 30 people because I think that’s the maximum we’ll fit into a local
pub. Look over the site and send me an email if you’re interested.

If you don’t live in Boston but want to organize your own Iron Blogger, you
can use the software in Nelson’s git repository (or my branch) to automate
nearly the whole process of tracking posts, generating reports, and updating
the ledger of debts.
